## SQL Learning Journey 

After working with **NoSQL databases**, I have now started learning **SQL databases**.

I will be sharing my **SQL learning journey daily for the next 10 days**. After completing these 10 days, I will move on to **PostgreSQL** and start building a **project** based on it.

**Day 1 of SQL learning has been successfully completed.**
**Day 2 of SQL learning has been successfully completed.**
